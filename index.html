        <h1>Alignment Of<br>
Organizational Strategy<br>
With Information<br>
Technology Strategy</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:20px;">Introduction</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital computers came into being after the Second World War. After a period
of use solely in scientific and military areas, business perceived that this
technological innovation could be very useful. The large, expensive equipment
was very limited in terms of the information it could process and store, in
addition to the restricted number of users who could access them simultaneously or from remote locations. Both the training and vision of professionals
in the area of what was then called “data processing” was eminently technical.
Thus, the early applications were developed to resolve well-structured problems, i.e., those whose stages and sequences were well-defined, such as
payroll, stock control, and accounts due and received.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology evolved and by the end of the 1970s, there were a number of
alternative uses for computers and basic applications had been installed in the
large companies. At that point, specialists began discussing a way to use Information Technology (IT), a term that came into use in the 1980s, better to
make businesses more competitive. From that time on, many theories, models,
and techniques have been studied and developed so that information technology can be used in tune with business strategies and operations.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT progressively came to play an important role in the strategy of the leading
companies in competitive markets</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently there are great expectations that IT applications will make possible
new strategy alternatives for business and new opportunities for companies; as
in the case of e-commerce and e-business (Porter, 2001; Evans & Wurster,
1999). However, there is also an extensive debate about the real gains derived
from investments in IT. Focusing solely on the efficiency of IT applications will
not provide a response to such questions. To evaluate the impact of IT on
business strategy and operations, a focus on its effectiveness is needed. One
must examine the results of IT applications in relation to the objectives, goals,
and needs of an organization. Effectiveness should be maintained in the long
run, and for this to happen, the concept of Strategic Alignment between IT and
the business is fundamental.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficacious use of IT and the integration of IT strategy and business strategy
extends beyond the concept of IT as a tool for productivity, which is often a
factor critical to success. Today, the route to such success is no longer related
just to the hardware and software employed, or even to development methodologies, but with the alignment of IT with the companies’ strategies, characteristics and organizational structure.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Rockart et al. (1996):</p>
    <p><i>"In sum, the load on IT organizations is heavier than ever before,
and the management of IT is more complex."</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this approach is the subject of the present chapter, which aims at
elucidating the main points that transform IT into a real tool for the competitiveness of organizations’ business strategies.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Conceptualizing Information Technology</h2>
         <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <h3>What is Information Technology, after all?</h3>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept ofInformation Technology is more inclusive than those of data
processing, information systems, software engineering, information science, or
the set of hardware and software programs, since it also involves human,
administrative and organizational dimensions (Keen, 1993).
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some authors, such as Alter (1992), distinguish between Information Technology and Information Systems, restricting the former to technical aspects,
while the latter correspond to issues related to the flow of work and the people
and information involved. Other authors, however, use the term information
technology to include both aspects, and such is the view of Henderson and
Venkatraman (1993).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Porter and Millar (1985), IT should be understood in a broad way
“to include all information that is created and utilized by business, and thus as
the broad spectrum of technologies which are increasingly convergent and
interconnected, that process this information. In addition to computers, therefore, data recognition equipment, technologies for communication, industrial
automation and other hardware and services are involved”. Thus, in this
chapter, the more inclusive term Information Technology (IT), which includes
information systems, the use of hardware and software, telecommunications,
automation, and multimedia resources utilized by organizations to provide data
and knowledge will be used (Luftman et al., 1993; Weil, 1992).</p>
        <h1 style="font-size:20px;">The “Productivity Paradox”</h1>
         <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, both the expectations around and the debate about the role of
IT have grown in academic publications, those devoted to executive and
business people and publications for the general public. On the one hand, there
have been questions about the results derived from investments in IT. On the
other, there is a kind of “enchantment” with IT applications making it possible
to activate mechanisms in the so-called “globalized economy”, and especially
those known as e-commerce and e-business (Porter, 2001; Tapscott, 2001;
Evans & Wurster, 1999; Frontini, 1999).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT evolved from its traditional orientation toward administrative support to a
strategic role within organizations. The vision of IT as a strategic competitive
weapon has been discussed and emphasized, since IT not only sustains existing
business operations, but also allows new business strategies to become viable.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, according to many authors (among them Henderson &
Venkatraman, 1993), when the aggregated global economy is considered, a
big doubt hovers around the existence of proof of significant gains in productivity due to the utilization of IT. This is what many refer to as the “IT
productivity paradox” or the computer paradox (Landauer and Solow apud
Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Brynjolfsson, 1993; Strassman, 1990). This debate
also often comes up in the business world.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the ideas of Carr (2003) have had a heavy and controversial
repercussion. He defends the hypothesis that IT in itself has no strategic value,
since its dissemination is so extensive that it is not possible to seek differentiation through it, and that what makes a resource truly strategic, is not it ubiquity,
but its scarceness. Thus, since the basic functions of IT are available and
accessible to all, their power and omnipresence have begun to transform them
from potentially strategic resources into “commoditized” productions elements.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless some hypotheses have been advance to explain the paradox
involving investments in IT (Brynjolfsson, 1993):</p>
      <ul> <li> <p><b>Errors in productivity measures. </b>The productivity of IT use is usually
measured poorly, and this is true for “inputs” (investments) as well as the
“outputs” (benefits). The greater problems of appropriate measurement
reside in the latter and there are special difficulties in the services sector
and the work of white-collar professionals. IT characteristics related to
quality, variety, customer service, speed, and response are particularly
hard to measure.</p></li>
          </ul>
        <ul>
  <li><p><b>Lag time between IT investments and benefits. </b>The benefits deriving
from the use of IT can take years to appear. This is due to the need to
accumulate experience in order to fully enjoy the potential of IT.</p></li>
</ul>
        <ul>
  <li><p><b>Redistribution. </b>IT can be a factor in productivity gains for an isolated
company, but not for the overall set of companies in an industry. Under
these circumstances, profits and participation in the market can be
redistributed, but the size of this market cannot be altered. This could lead
IT to modify the minimum requirements for participation in this market.</p></li>
</ul>
        <ul>
  <li><p><b>Bad IT management. </b>There are deficiencies in IT effectiveness evaluation practices and reasons on the order of internal company policies that
can lead to a lack of gains with the use of IT.
</p></li>
</ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of the problems in measuring IT productivity is the implantation
of automatic bank tellers. When ATMs (automatic teller machines) were
installed, people often stopped using checks. If there were a measure of
productivity in the bank related to the number of check processed, a drop in
revenues would be detected! The gains in client convenience resulting from the
service, however, are hard to measure. In addition, it is just as hard, or even
more so, to measure how much the bank profits with the increased customer
satisfaction derived from this convenience.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is emphasized that this debate about the return on IT investment is also taking
place on the inside of companies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), this lack of ability on the
part of companies to obtain considerable return on their investment in IT is due
(although not completely) to a lack of coordination and alignment of the
strategies for business and for IT. This adjustment between business strategy,
IT, and the internal structures of the company, with a view to it positioning and
activity in the market is not an isolated event or one that is easy to obtain, but
a dynamic process and one that continues over time.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it can be stated that no application of IT, considered in isolation, for as
sophisticated as it might be, can maintain a competitive advantage. This can
only be obtained by the ability of the company to strategically exploit IT in a
continuous way.</p>
        <h1>The Efficiency and Effectiveness of<br>
Information Technology Applications</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concepts of efficiency and effectiveness are very useful to an understanding
of the role of IT in organizations (Laurindo, Carvalho & Shimizu, 2003;
Maggiolini, 1981).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, efficiency means making good use of things, while effectiveness means
doing the right things. Efficiency is related to the use of resources, while effectiveness is related to meeting goals, objectives, and requirement. Efficiency is related to aspects internal to IT activity and the adequate use of
resources, while effectiveness compares the results of IT applications with the
results of the company’s business and possible impacts on its operations and
structure. To be efficacious in IT means using it to leverage the company’s
business, making it more competitive (Figure 5.1).</p>
        <h1>Critical Success Factors (CSF)</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first attempts to link the use of IT to companies’ objectives and
strategies arose at the end of the 1970s, and was proposed by Rockart (1979):
the Critical Success Factor (CSF) method which is still widely used today to
plan and prioritize IT applications. Rockart was seeking to resolve the problem
of formulating managerial information systems.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this method, managerial information systems and those that
produce performance indicators for a company should be based on the
executive’s own definitions of the information needs. The focus of the proposed
approach is in the CSF, which “are a limited number of areas in which results,
if satisfactory, guarantee the organization’s successful competitive performance.”</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rockart, the main origins of CSF are: the structure of the industry, the
competitive strategy, the positioning of the company within the industry, its
geographic location, the environment, and circumstantial factors</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the CSF method includes an analysis of the industry in which the
company is inserted, as well as its strategy, methods, and competitors. This
analysis is followed by two or three interview sessions with the executives,
aimed at identifying the CSF, indicating their relationship to the company’s
business objectives, and defining their respective qualitative or quantitative
indicators. Finally, the information systems to control the CSF are defined,
along with their indicators.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rockart, this process can be useful for each level of the company and
should be repeated periodically, since the CSF change over time and can be
different from one individual to another.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its being conceived originally to design information systems and
especially managerial and executive information systems, the CSF method had
an important impact on managerial practices and strategic planning. Beyond its
utilization in planning information systems and in administering IT projects, it
has been used in the strategic planning of business and in the implementation of
strategies, in managing changes and as a competitive analysis technique
(Pollalis & Frieze, 1993). This method takes an approach based in directives,
through focusing on the essential issues of companies. Further, the continuous
measurement of CSF allows companies to identify strengths and weaknesses
in their main departments, processes, and functions (Rockart, 1979; Sullivan,
1985; Rockart & Crescenzi, 1984; Martin, 1982).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it is not a complete methodology since it leaves gaps with regard
to transnational information systems, there is agreement that it is very useful in
developing managerial information systems. It allows a vision of the means and
alternatives for improving the functions and areas of crucial importance to the
company, and makes the connection between information systems and the
company’s business clearer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal similar to Rockart’s CSF model was developed by Broadbent and
Weil (1997), who proposed a model called “Management by Maxim” which
analyzes and defines the main principles which should guide the business and
IT of each company. With this, it is possible to define the infrastructure and IT
services that would combine with the company’s competitive and strategic
positioning.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992), is, in a
certain fashion, a more systematic extension of the CSF idea. It is a method for
measuring and directing company activities in accordance with its strategy. The
method uses four sets of interconnected measurements, each of which focuses
on a perspective: the financial, that of the client, that of innovation and learning,
and the perspective internal to the business. Each of these perspectives has its
own set of goals and measures.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Balanced Scorecard is not an especially focused method for
IT planning, it has direct implications for the definition of information systems
with potential strategic impact. Willcocks and Lester (1997), among others,
suggest using theBalanced Scorecard in the strategic planning of IT, especially
in the phases of development and implementation.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> The Strategic Role of IT Applications</h1>
         <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McFarlan’s (1984) strategic Grid allows us to visualize how IT is related to
strategy and to business operations in a company. This model analyzes the
present and future impact of IT applications on the business, defining four
“quadrants” (Figure 5.2), each of which represents a situation for the company:
“Support”, “Factory”, “Transition”, and “Strategy” (see also Fernades &
Kugler, 1990).</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Support”: IT has little influence on present and future company strategies.
There is no need for a highlighted positioning for the IT area in the company
hierarchy. Usually this is what happens in a traditional manufacturing company.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Factory”: the existing IT applications contribute decisively to the company’s
success, but new applications with strategic impact are not contemplated. The
IT department should be situated at a high level of hierarchy. The classic
example is the case of airline companies, which depend on their ticket
reservation systems, but new developments just update these applications.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Transition”: IT moves from a more discrete position (in the “support”
quadrant) to one of greater visibility in the company strategy. The IT area tends
toward a position of greater importance in the company’s hierarchy. The
example usually cited in the literature is electronic publishing. Today, ecommerce displays the same profile. From occupying a role in operational
support in commercial enterprises, it has become an agent for
business transformation. “Strategic”: IT has great influence on the general
strategy of companies. Present as well as future applications are strategic and
affect the company’s business. In this case, it is important that IT be positioned
at a high level of hierarchy. IT has a strategic role in banks for instance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To evaluate the strategic impact of IT, McFarlan (1984) proposed an analysis
of five basic questions about IT applications, related to the forces of competition forces (Porter, 1979):</p>
        <ul>
  <li>Can IT establish entry barriers for market competitors?</li>
            <li>Can IT influence the change of suppliers as well as alter bargaining power?</li>
            <li>Can IT change the basis of competition (based on cost, differentiation, or
focus)?</li>
            <li>Can IT alter bargaining power in relationships with buyers?</li>
            <li>Can IT generate new products?</li>
</ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions serve to guide executives in their search for new competitive
advantages through IT, whether it is in their internal organization or in their
relationship with other companies or their customers. These questions can be
used to orient the strategic use of IT, aiming at the creation of new interrelationship among companies, such as forming partnership or cooperative
networks.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the strategic importance of IT can vary from one industry to another
and also among companies in the same industry.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT has played an important role in the strategy of the leading companies in
competitive markets. Two matters are basic to an understanding of the role of
IT: obtaining advantages over competitors all along the value chain (Porter &
Millar, 1985), and the creation and reinforcement of essential competencies
(Duhan et al., 2001).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern with regard to the value chain is in understanding how IT can
increase competitive advantages by cost reduction, constructing entry barriers,
and strengthening the company’s relations with suppliers and consumers. With
regard to essential competencies, the focus of concern is on resources. Thus,
competitive advantages are born of the ability to accumulate capacities and
resources that are rare, valuable and hard to imitate.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porter and Miller (1985) highlight the concepts of the value chain (activities
inside the company linked by connections and which have one physical
component and another of information processing) and value systems (the set
of value chains of an industry from the suppliers to the final consumer).</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT permeates the chains of value, changing the way of executing activities of
value and also the nature of the connections among them. In doing so, IT can
affect competition in three possible ways:
</p>
        <ul>
  <li>by changing the structure of the sector since it has the ability to influence
each of the five forces of competition (Porter, 1979);</li>
            <li>by creating new competitive advantages, reducing costs, increasing
differentiation, and altering the scope of competition scope;by generating completely new business.</li>
            <li>by generating completely new business.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Figure 5.3 there are examples of IT applications according to the nine generic
middle activities and the generic end activities presented along the value chain.
The impact on the value system will be studied in the chapter on the New
Economy</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential that IT has to make these changes varies according to the
characteristics of the process (value chain) and the product, with reference to
information needs. The “Information intensity matrix” considers the value chain
and analyzes “how much” information is contained in the process and the
product (see Figure 5.4). In companies whose products and processes contain
a lot of information, the information system will be very important (Porter &
Miller, 1985).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their original article, Porter and Millar, (1985) did not cite an example for
“high information content in the product” or “low information intensity in the
process”, a position which is corroborated by Doyle (1991). However, for</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ward (1988), this would be the case of educational and law firms; for Duhan
et al. (2001), consulting firms would also fit in this same quadrant.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, according Dunah et. al. (2001), an analysis of the value chain would
be impaired in the case of knowledge based companies (such as consulting
firms) where it is hard to identify the value that is aggregated to each activity.
In these situations, the authors propose that using the essential competencies
of Prahalad and Hamel (1990) would be more appropriate to plan the strategic
use of information systems.</p>
        <h1>Strategic Alignment</h1>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) proposed a model that emphasizes and
analyzes the strategic importance of the role performed by IT inside companies.
The proposed model is based on factors inside and outside the company. IT
impacts on the company’s business and how these affect its organization and
IT strategy are analyzed, along with what is available in the market in terms of
new technologies. This proposal is called the “Strategic Alignment Model.”</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henderson and Venkatraman also propose that I addition to the widely
recognized need for an adjustment between the company’s strategy and its
internal structure, it should analogously have made adjustments between the
external IT strategy (positioning in the IT market) and the internal structure of
its information systems (their organization and administration).
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, according to this model, in order to plan IT, the external factors
(strategy) and internal factors (infrastructure) that should be considered are:
negotiating strategy, IT strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and the infrastructure of information systems and processes.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another premise of the Model for Strategic Alignment is that an efficacious
administration of IT requires a balance among the decisions in all four factors
listed above. The model highlights two types of integration between the
domains of business and IT: the strategic and operational.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This model’s novelty is that it considers that IT strategy can change a
company’s business strategy, when usually the business strategy is considered
as the starting point for IT planning. Planning has to a continuous process, since
external factors are constantly changing. If the company does not accompany
these changes, it can be seriously impaired in the sharp competition for markets.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly true when a new technology is adopted by almost all
companies in a sector of activity and thus it is no longer an element of
competitive advantage for the user and becomes a factor of disadvantage for
the nonuser.</p>
        <h2>The Perspectives for Strategic Alignment</h2>
        <hr width="100%" size="5" color="black" noshade>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), and Luftman et al. (1993) point to four
main perspectives on strategic alignment, taking as their start point either the
negotiating strategy or IT strategy as the driver of this process:</p>
        <ol>
  <li><b>Executing the strategy</b></li>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Strategy "Business Structure " IT Structure
This is the most widely disseminated and best understood perspective
since it corresponds to the classical model of a hierarchical vision of
strategic administration. As an example, we cite the case of the publisher
McGraw Hill whose strategy for publishing books on order for American
universities required support from an IT application.</p>
<li><b>Technological transformation</b></li>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Strategy " IT Strategy " IT Structure
From this perspective, note that the IT structure is not limited by the
structure of the organization of business. The negotiating strategy requires
new IT strategies (including new competencies) to be implemented. This</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Image Description">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective can be illustrated by the case of a traditional bookstore (such
as Siciliano, Saraiva, or Cultura) which, when setting up a computerized
“megastore” or an internet site, needs a new IT strategy, since formerly
this resource had not been used so intensely.</p>

The choice of business strategy derives from the new IT strategy adopted.
The typical example of this perspective is companies that are born as pure
players on the Internet (like Amazon.com). There was an IT strategy (to
dominate the Internet) and it made the business strategy that made use of
this IT strategy viable</p>

This perspective aims at serving a world class clientele in Information
System services. It can be exemplified by companies that outsource IT
services such as Kodak and British Petroleum.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 5.1 shows the role of company management and the role of IT as well as
the respective basic criteria to evaluate performance for each of these perspectives. Note that the role of the managers changes, which results in different
abilities. Figure 5.5 shows a schematic for the flow of the alignment process
from each of the four perspectives.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luftman (1996) also proposed that in some situations there could be a merger
of two perspectives. In these cases, two perspectives are identified as
occurring simultaneously; they have the same starting and arrival points, but run
different routes.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some research has suggested factors, which, when present along with good
performance, work as enablers of strategic alignment. Luftman (2001) listed
five of these factors: support of senior executives for IT, involvement of IT in
the development of strategy, understanding IT in the company’s business,
partnership between business and IT, well-prioritized design of IT and, IT
exercising leadership. On the other hand, the absence or poor performance of
these factors is considered inhibitors of strategic alignment.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prairie (1996), in turn, studied the critical points for the use of IT that lead to
leveraging business:
</p>
        <ul>
  <li>existence of a defined strategy;
</li>
            <li>development of customer-centered measurements;</li>
            <li>fitting IT processes and capabilities to business objectives and the
insertion of business goals in IT processes and capabilities;
</li>
            <li>finally, IT should be a matter of interest to all, not just to technicians.</li>
</ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the strategic alignment model was conceived for analyzing IT
strategy in organizations, its concepts can be very useful for the strategic
planning of relationships among companies, which are relationship among
companies enabled or potentialized by IT.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a complement, Weill and Ross (2002) highlight the importance of having
decisions about the use of IT involve the business people in the company, and
not just the IT team, so that business-strategy issues be contemplated. An
exclusively technical focus does not allow decision-making that leads to the use
of IT as a factor for competitive advantage.</p>
